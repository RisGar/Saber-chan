4 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * no-shadow:
    - ESLint does not support disabling shadowed variable checks based on whether their names start with underscore or not, please use 'allow' in eslint configuration to provide specific variable names you want to disable the rule for.
    - ESLint does not support selectively disabling shadowed declaration checks depending on the type of declaration, so all kinds of declarations are checked.
  * camelcase:
    - Leading undescores in variable names will now be ignored.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading and trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be ignored.
  * @typescript-eslint/quotes:
    - Option "avoid-template" is not supported by ESLint.

2 rules are not known by tslint-to-eslint-config to have ESLint equivalents:
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "prefer-switch".
  * tslint-to-eslint-config does not know the ESLint equivalent for TSLint's "whitespace".
